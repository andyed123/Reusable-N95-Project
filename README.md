# Reusable-N95-Project
## Urgent design, testing, distribution, guideline in light of disrupted N95 supply to COVID-19 era Canada
Back-up stop-gap plan for N95 depletion in Ontario, Canada

Reuse of N95 preferred at this stage by decontamination (VPHP, UVGI, Heat)

## Repo of CAD (and other big files)
- repo: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/exq93iisr1vuk3s/AACLyBetassTvupc8qk6WR29a?dl=0

## Options
### Montana 3D
- website: Instagram #MakeTheMask

### Intermountain 3D (I3D) modification of Montana
- website: https://www.intermountain3d.com/covid-respirators.html

### NIH released open sources
- https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response
- many variations to choose from, apart form the above, which have gained traction and use in several hospitals

## Prototype
- I3D XS, S, M prototypes built
- Iteration required

## Local Testing
### Form fit test
### Bitrex Testing
- Functional Test as form any in-person testing using "spray under the hood"
### Decontamination
- Designs ideally be washable in chlorox 1:10 (as for faceshields) and dried
- Will eventually need microbiology to chip in
