# Reusable-N95-Project 
## [APIL](apil.ca)-CIGITI-[GLIA](glia.org)-Lakehead-NOSM-Queen's-UofT collab
### Urgent design, testing, recommendation, upscale in industry, dissemination of guidelines in light of disrupted N95 supply to COVID-19 era Canada
- Investigate back-up stop-gap plan for N95 depletion in Ontario, Canada
- Reuse of N95 is preferred at this stage by decontamination (VPHP, UVGI, Heat).

- 00-Timeline/N95 Project Management 20200413.xlsx

*Current focus*:
- form-fit test Manitoba Simple Silicone Respirator with HME bacterial/viral filters and focus on refining
- ~form-fit test APIL NIH Unibody Silicone Respirator with HME bacterial/viral filters~ pause on this design

*Weekly focus*:
- Dual flat filter in tightly-sealed cartridge system to increased surface area for airflow. We better start NOW.

*Medium term challenge*:
- HME filter sourcing - Merv-15 x 2-ply, Woodbridge INOAC 5-ply, Billings MERV 14 2-Ply, +/- 1-ply Halyard H100 Okay
- Estimation of unit *Cost* and *Time* to producing first 1000 units.

## Options
### NIH released open sources
- https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response
- many variations to choose from, apart form the above, which have gained traction and use in several hospitals
- UHN APIL modification to Unibody Silicone with adapter for 15mm to 22mm adapter.

### Simple Silicone Respirator by Christian Petropolis at HSC Manitoba
- silicone material dragon skin sx pro to 10, durometer 2A - 10
- attaches to commerical filters 15mm to 22mm; M size fits small to large; planning for S and L sizes.

### "Kingston" Mask - Queen's Initiative
- http://ppekingston.squarespace.com/
- Modification of Montana with different sizing, filter size, geometry, *nose-pinching mechanism*
- fit-testing done by OSH at KGH
### Montana 3D by Billings, Montana
- website: Instagram #MakeTheMask, https://www.makethemasks.com
### Intermountain 3D (I3D) modification of Montana
- website: https://www.intermountain3d.com/covid-respirators.html
### Concordia (Wisconsin) masks
- https://blog.cuw.edu/COVIDmasks/, both modification of Montana and dual-cartridge, folded 3DP models.

## Prototype, Refinement (Josh)
- I3D XS, S, M prototypes built
- Montana S, M, L size (modified)
- NIH S, M. (XS needs redesigning)
- Kingston XS, S, M, L, XL, Snowcone S, M - Fit-test Kingston Masks from Queen's - 23 April 2020
- Manitoba SSR M (S to come)
- Seal and fit problem
- Onepiece Silicone Iteration required 16 April 2020
- Filtration area needs to be maximally increased for WOB and any remote chance of getting NIOSH testing
- Considering 2 filter cartridge system with tight seal (Brandon/Jay Pooley)
- ~Adapter to ROXON filter functional as stop-gap option~ (no longer pursued given poor NIOSH testing)
- ~single filter cartridge system with N95 medium~ (no longer pursued given poor breathability with good mask seal)

## [Local Testing](https://github.com/bachnwill/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/04-Testing) (Andrew)
### Particulate and NIOSH test
- James Scott and Jeff Brook from UofT OS & EH 13 April 2020 - proof of concept testing
- excluded single FLAT N95 filter option, either double cartridge system, or pleated bacterial/viral filter required.
- Consider pursuing N90 grade with Merv 15 filter (suggested by Queen's https://www.mcmaster.com/22905k28)

### [OSHA and Bitrex Testing](https://github.com/bachnwill/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/04-Testing/Test%20Protocol%20-%20Bitrex.md)
- Portacount or AccuFIT fit-testing as per OSHA/CSA protocol, standard 7 Fit-Factor Rubric: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA
- Pooling Non-UHN partners SickKids, Queen's University (KHSC), other OHS to perform CSA standard mask-fit test
- Functional Test as form any in-person testing using "spray under the hood" Bitrex
- UHN OHS involved, Craig Parsons and Sharon Martin (TBC by Frank Turner). UHN IPAC represented by Dr Alon Vaisman.

### [Decontamination (Vahid)](https://github.com/bachnwill/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/06-Decontamination/Decontamination%20Protocol.md)
- Designs ideally be washable in chlorox 1:10 (as for faceshields) and dried
- Will eventually need microbiology to chip in
- Viral testing is a possibility
