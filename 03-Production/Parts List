Models
- I3D Montana with round edge, XS, S, M
- Montana, S, M, L
- NIH "SFM", S, M

Mask
 - Prototype Material was Nylon 12 powder using SLS printer
 - Future Suggestions include: silicone, zotefoams (plastazote/evazote)
 
Rubber Seal Strip for I3D Montana
 - Seal required around rim of mask for comfort and better seal
 - Trial of industrial-grade rubber window seal
 - "MD Rubber Window Seal Medium 5/16, 7.9mm base" WS31126
 - "MD Rubber Window Seal Small 3/8, 9.5mm base" WS31124 [I checked, the base is wider than medium]
 - http://mdbuildingproducts.com/product/38-in-x-200-ft-all-climate-d-strip-weather-strip/
 - can be sourced from HomeDepot online and picked up.

Silicone Seal strip for NIH, 
- currently two main ideas, both cast: Rim vs. Inlay
- Thickness and durometric grade (e.g. eco 00-30) TBC
- Stethoscope silicone tubing hard meld together (will try over Easter weekend), does not appear comfortable, slips off

Elastic
- Locally sourced elastic
- Top strip net length <22", needs to be adjustable
- Bottom strip net length <18", needs to be adjustable

Filter
- Gold Standard 3M 5N11 [Matt has given us sample]
- Woodbridge INOAC N95 filter
- Halyard H600 2 ply autoclaved has been tried, but high resistance
- Halyard H300 2 ply is easy to breathe through; this needs to be tested and validated for N95 particulate
- Hepafiberglass by camfil H&V, very high resistance and needs specification [Matt]

"the NIOSH N95 specification requires a more extensive battery of testing, than the sterilization wraps.  
One of the key tests - Bacterial Filtration Efficiency - is done for both.  
Both 3M 95s and  the Halyard H300 and H600 (NOT the H100) have BFE > 99 %.  
The N95 certification according to NIOSH, however, is based on Particulate Filtration Efficiency 
with particles of 0.3 microns.  Further, to be a "Surgical N95" - which is designed to protect against 
pressurized fluids/particles as could be expected with a cough or sneeze, requires Fluid Resistance testing." AS
"I've reached out to Halyard to request more technical specifications, 
but they made a point of repeating that they do not recommend that their 
products be used for anything other than their intended purpose, 
and they are not tested with the same battery of tests as masks/gowns." AS
